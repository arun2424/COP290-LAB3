# COP290-LAB3

This lab will be done in groups of four. The main objective is to design and develop a website.

You need to design and develop APIs required for a website and set-up a database on MySQL. Data for your websites can be obtained online from websites like Kaggle. Then, you will design the frontend for the website and get it running. You will also implement unit and integration tests and run them continuously. 

Next step is to add a login page while the website is up and running, while checking if the other components are not getting affected using the tests implemented in the previous part. The login page should take basic information (with picture optional) from a user and then add the user to the database. It is advised to use an encryption algorithm to store passwords. 

Last step is to add an existing Machine Learning API as a feature of your website. You can choose an API hosted by google listed here. This API can be used to make an existing feature better i.e. add recommendation to a selling website or have personalised feeds on Twitter type platform. Or you can plan and add a new feature altogether.
